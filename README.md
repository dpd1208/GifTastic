# GifTastic

Project Overview

The GifTastic App allows a user to view an assortment of 10 gifs related to a particular topic. General topics are available by default to select. However, a user can add as many topics of his or her own choice using the form located on the right side of the web page. Gifs populate the left side. 

Once the gifs have populated the page, the user can click on the still images to view the animated experience. Clicking on the animated gif will make it still again.
